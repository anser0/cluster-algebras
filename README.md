# UMN Combinatorics and Algebra REU 2024

This repository contains code written by Serena An, Casey Appleton, and Sogol Cyrusian as part of a research project titled "Mixed Dimer Model for Exceptional Type Quiver Representations and Cluster Algebras". The research was conducted under mentor Kayla Wright and graduate student TA Elise Catania as part of University of Minnesota Twin Cities' 2024 Combinatorics and Algebra REU.

The file [critical_arrows](https://github.com/anser0/cluster-algebras/blob/main/critical_arrows.ipynb) contains all critical arrow combinations for $\underline{d} = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1)$ in type $E_6$ quivers, which distinguish terms that appear and do not appear in the $F$-polynomial.
